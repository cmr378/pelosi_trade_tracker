    2. **Data Extraction and Parsing**
        - Extracts detailed trade data, including ticker symbols, transaction types, dates, and amounts.
        - Parses associated PDF documents for additional transaction details.
    3, **Continuous Monitoring**
        - Periodically checks for updates on financial disclosure files.
    4. **JSON Storage**
        - Saves extracted data into structured JSON files for analysis.

### Crypto Tracker

    1. **Price Monitoring**
        - Continuously monitors the prices of specified cryptocurrencies.
    2. **Retrieves opening prices at the start of the day and calculates thresholds for buy orders.
    3. **Buy Order Trigger**
        - Automatically places a buy order if the current price falls below a specified threshold.
    4. **JSON Storage**
        - Saves the timeline of prices to a JSON file for record-keeping and analysis.
